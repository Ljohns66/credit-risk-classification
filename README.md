A summary: Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.


Analysis Overview:
The purpose of the analysis was to predict Healthy vs Risky loan performance from a provided data set.

**The results: ** 

                              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           Healthy Loans         1.00      1.00      1.00     18759
           High Risk Loans       0.87      0.89      0.88       625

* The healthy loan scores were amazing and the high risk loans were also decently high! 
  
* Precision Score - showed much higher for Healthy Loans vs Risky 1.00/0.87 respectively.
* Recall Score - same as above showing 1.00/0.89.
* F1 Score can also be noted - 1.00/0.88.

I would use recommend using the model. The percision got 87% of the high risk predicted correclty as high risk, while Healthy loans was perfect. The recall was strong showing 89% of actual high risks loans identified. It does a good job on both predictions, but it's better at predicting Healthy loans. This makes sense given there's a much larger population of "healthy Loans" with 18765 instances vs only 619 High risk. You should consider there is a chance of 13% of the model missing a high risk loan. So the company using this model would have to consider the risk here.
